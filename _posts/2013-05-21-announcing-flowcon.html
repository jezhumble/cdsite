<p>I spend quite a lot of time at conferences, and it consistently bothers me that they are so often focused on one particular function: development, testing, UX, systems administration. The point of continuous delivery is to accelerate the rate at which we can learn from each other - and from our customers. That requires everyone involved in the delivery process (including users, product owners and entrepreneurs) to collaborate throughout. So why isn't there a conference which focuses on <em>flow</em> - the emergent property of great teams?</p>
<p>So I got together with a bunch of like-minded folks - <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Elizabeth+Hendrickson">Elisabeth Hendrickson</a>, <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Gene+Kim">Gene Kim</a>, <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/John+Esser">John Esser</a> and <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Lane+Halley">Lane Halley</a> - and now there is a conference about creating flow: <a href="http://flowcon.org/">FlowCon</a>. It's on <strong>Friday November 1 in San Francisco</strong>, and it's produced by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> and <a href="http://www.trifork.com/">Trifork</a> (creators of the <a href="http://gotocon.com/">GOTO conferences</a>).</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-949"></a></p>
<p>The conference is based around four values:</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong>: Our goal is to provide the best possible conference forum for practitioners to learn from each other how to build great products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Open Information</strong>: We aim to uncover how great products and services are built in real life and make this information freely available to the widest audience possible.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity</strong>: We believe the technology community - and thus the conference speakers and participants - should reflect the demographics of our customers and the wider world.</p>
<p><strong>Spanning boundaries</strong>: We believe that the best products and services are created collaboratively by people with a range of skills and experiences.</p>
<p>We have put together nearly half of the <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp">program</a>, and we're delighted to announce that <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Adrian+Cockcroft">Adrian Cockcroft</a>, <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Catherine+Courage">Catherine Courage</a>, <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Jeff+Gothelf">Jeff Gothelf</a> and <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Linda+Rising">Linda Rising</a> will be giving keynotes. <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp">The program</a> is still a work in process (a minimum viable product, if you will). In particular, the after lunch sessions are empty - for a good reason: <strong>we want <em>you</em> to speak in those slots</strong>. We're looking for people working to create flow in their organization - especially those who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Span multiple roles and work across organizational silos.</li>
<li>Work in any of the following areas: a highly regulated environment; a large, traditional enterprise; in the pursuit of social and economic justice.</li>
<li>Are willing to share obstacles encountered or mistakes made and how you overcame them - whether cultural or technological.</li>
<li>Offer actionable advice "the rest of us" can apply today (even if we don't have the resources of Etsy / Amazon / Google).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your talk could be about culture, technology, design, process - the only really important criterion is that it draws on what you've learned about helping to create flow in your organization.</p>
<p><strong>If that sounds like you, please <a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/submit">submit your proposal</a>. If you know someone who would do a great job, please encourage them to submit. Our submission process is designed to be entirely merit-based, which means that the first round is anonymous. The deadline is midnight Pacific time, Sunday June 23, 2013.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://secure.trifork.com/flowcon-sanfran-2013/registration/">Tickets for the conference are now on sale</a> - at $350 if you register before July 31, or $500 if you register afterwards. Whatever your role or domain, you're sure to find inspirational, disruptive thinking that will make you better at creating great products and services. I hope to see you there!</p>
