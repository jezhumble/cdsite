### Disclosures ###

I work at Google and the University of California, Berkeley. This site is not maintained as part of my official work duties, and is not endorsed by either Google or UC Berkeley. In addition to my compensation, I receive royalties from my books and related content. If you buy my stuff via the links on this site, I get a cut from the vendor, whether Amazon or InformIT. All my investments are in wide-ranging mutual funds.

### A note on contacting me ###

The best way to reach me is by email at humble@acm.org, but unfortunately due to the large amount of email I receive I'm afraid I can't guarantee a response. To increase your chances of a reply try a query that is short and has a simple yes/no answer. In particular, I have learned from experience not to offer advice over the internet. If you're not sure how to proceed, I have two pieces of general advice: first, work from [first principles](https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/). Second, apply the scientific method: Mike Rother's [Improvement Kata](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html) is an excellent resource.
