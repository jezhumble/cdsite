title: Implementing Continuous Delivery
---

Organizations attempting to deploy continuous delivery tend to make
two common mistakes. The first is to treat continuous delivery as an
end-state, a goal in itself. The second is to spend a lot of time and
energy worrying about what products to use.

In this section you can read about the two biggest impediments to
continuous delivery:
enterprise [architecture](/implementing/architecture/), and
organizational [culture](/implementing/culture/). You can also see a set
of [patterns](/implementing/patterns/) that have been successfully
applied to increase throughput, stability and quality.
